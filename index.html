    <p>I think i am not the only one who gone though this, there are thousands of people over there who suffered this, few of them lost their complete families it had been very serious , Stress and anxiety are common experiences for most people</p>
    <p>In this many people affected emotinally and mentally, i would like to share few remedies to brace and uplift</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Write it down: One way to handle stress is to write things down, Gratitude may help relieve stress and anxiety by focusing your thoughts on what’s positive in your life.</li>
        <li>Learn to avoid procrastination: Another way to take control of your stress is to stay on top of your priorities and stop procrastinating. 
            Procrastination can lead you to act reactively, leaving you scrambling to catch up. This can cause stress, which negatively affects your health and sleep quality</li>
        <li>Stress hormones: Exercise lowers your body’s stress hormones — such as cortisol — in the long run. It also helps release endorphins, which are chemicals that improve your mood and act as natural painkillers.        </li>
        <li>Sleep: Exercise can also improve your sleep quality, which can be negatively affected by stress and anxiety.        </li>
        <li>Confidence: When you exercise regularly, you may feel more competent and confident in your body, which in turn promotes mental wellbeing.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>spend your more time with friends and family</h2>
    <p>One study found that for women in particular, spending time with friends and children helps release oxytocin, a natural stress reliever. This effect is called “tend and befriend,” and is the opposite of the fight-or-flight response</p>
